This project is the tool to combine javascript files together to one single file using
the same concept as include file in C language. Header has to be added to each file to
tell the combiner the order of the files to be combined.

Here is the example of the header

//#include "script1.js"
//#include "../../script2.js"
//#include <script3.js>
//#include <module1/script4.js>

If the file name resides within two double quotes, the compiler will read the file at
the reference path of the script that has this include header. If the file name reside
within brackets, the compiler will look for the file start from the path that specified
together with -i parameter (include path).

Here's the usage of the command

jscombiner [-?] [-i <includePath>] [-p <sourceFilePattern>] -o <outputFile> <inputFile/dir> [<inputFile/dir> <inputFile/dir> ...]

Parameters:
  -?    Show this help
  -i    Specify the include path which will be use when script is referred in
        bracket format (<script.js>). This option is optional.
  -o    Specify the output file. This option is mandatory.
  -p    Specify the source file scan pattern. Default is *.js
  
There has to be at least one input file.
